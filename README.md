# NUCEE Award Automation 🎓⚡  

Automation scripts developed during my role as **Finance Assistant at Northeastern University Center for Entrepreneurship Education (NUCEE)**.  

These scripts automate the creation of **Award Letters & Invoices** for student venture funding programs under **Mosaic** and **IDEA** (NUCEE’s venture accelerator ecosystem).  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Traditionally, the NUCEE team collected student venture details via Google Forms and then **manually copied the information into Award Letter & Invoice templates**.  
This process was repetitive and time-consuming.  

I automated the workflow using **Google Apps Script** so that:  
- With **one click**, the system generates both Award Letters & Invoices.  
- Documents are saved as **PDFs in Google Drive**, properly named and organized.  
- The process is **faster, error-free, and requires no manual entry**.

## 📂 Scripts Included  
- **AlphaFund_AwardAutomation.gs** → Automates Award Letters & Invoices for the **Alpha Fund**.  
- **GapFund_AwardAutomation.gs** → Automates Award Letters & Invoices for the **GAP Fund**.

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Pulls responses directly from **Google Forms → Google Sheets**  
- ✅ Populates **Google Docs templates** (Award Letter & Invoice)  
- ✅ Exports final documents as **PDFs** into Google Drive  
- ✅ Auto-generates file & folder names for easy organization  
- ✅ Saves **hours of manual copy-pasting** for the NUCEE team
